# Advent of Code "solutions" in Python

This repository holds all my current solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges from 2015 to 2019.

State of the code by year:

* **2015**: _Completed_. Code mostly good
* **2016**: In progress (almost there), some of it doesn't run well
* **2017**: _Completed_. Old code, lots of it definitely broken.
* **2018**: Incomplete. Some broken code.
* **2019**: Ongoing.

## Disclaimer

This is not good code. It is entirely undocumented, mostly untested, not guaranteed to be correct, and most certainly does not reflect any best practices outside formatting. I don't think my AoC solutions are particularly exotic, but that's subjective.

## Requirements

This code **requires Python 3.8** to run. Before you ask, yes I use the "Walrus" operator. No, I don't care if you hate it. And that's not the only 3.8 feature I use so deal with it.

Other requirements:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (known to work with 1.17)
* [Parsimonious](https://pypi.org/project/parsimonious/)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the (few) tests
